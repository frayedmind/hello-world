# hello-world
I'm Lee and a nice chap who wants to join other's in learning to code. I come from the UK but am based in Thailand.
I joined Github as Freecodecamp recommended I do this. I can see why repositries are a great idea and look forward 
to being useful. Good luck to all. Im dedicated, so lets see what happens. Bye for now :)
